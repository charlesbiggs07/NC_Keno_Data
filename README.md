# NC_Keno_Data
.csv files of NCEL Keno drawings up to ~ Game #500000 

In an effort to learn something about 'Big Data' whilst
laid low with long-haul Covid, the data has been scraped
from the website, cleaned, and coordinated into two files.
The first is in it's semi-raw form and includes the time 
the game was drawn.  The next is somewhat whittled down to 
include on the the game number, results, and the multiplier
field, where applicable.

Please enjoy these files and use your best algorithsm to 
discover that there may yet be randomness in the world of
numbers.
