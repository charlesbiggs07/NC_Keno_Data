# NC_Keno_Data
.csv files of NCEL Keno drawings up to ~ Game #500000 

In an effort to learn something about 'Big Data' whilst
laid low with long-haul Covid, the data has been scraped
from the website, cleaned, and coordinated into two files.
The files represent two halves due to github's 25MB file
restriction.  The files are somewhat whittled down to 
include on the the game number, results, and the multiplier
field, where applicable.

The NCEL website is:  www.https://nclottery.com/keno-results

Please enjoy these files and use your best algorithms to 
discover that there may yet be randomness in the world of
big numbers.
